# Smart Mirror Instructions

This project is a simple web server used to host a smart mirror display that can be used to display the weather, news, time and date. It allows someone with an old laptop, one way glass/acrylic and a bit of DIY experience to easily create a smart mirror at home with very little coding knowledge. To see a running demonstration of the display please see the link below.
